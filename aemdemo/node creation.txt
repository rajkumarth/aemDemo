HOW TO  CREATE REPOSITORY NODES THOROUGH JAVA IN ADOBE EXPERIENCE MANAGER(AEM)
We can create the repository nodes inAdobe Experience Manager(AEM) through Java API , the below code snippet will help us to create the nodes in Adobe Experience Manager(AEM).

private static final String BASE_PATH = "/etc/commerce/products"; // the folder under which the nodes should be created

//Get the Resource resolver from request - Creating the node through Servlet
ResourceResolver resolver = request.getResourceResolver();

//Get the Resource resolver through resolver factory - Creating the node through Service
@Reference
private ResourceResolverFactory resolverFactory;//Get the resolverFactory reference in the service

ResourceResolver resolver = resolverFactory.getAdministrativeResourceResolver(null);//Get the resolver

//Get the session
Session session = resolver.adaptTo(Session.class);

//Create the Node
Node node = JcrUtil.createPath(BASE_PATH+<<Node Name>>, JcrConstants.NT_UNSTRUCTURED, session);

//Set the required properties
node.setProperty("name", "sample");
node.setProperty("description", "sample");

//Save the session
session.save();

While creating the NT_UNSTRUCTURED node make sure the parent folder is sling:folder, the node will not be created if the parent node is of type nt::folder.
